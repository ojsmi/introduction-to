# CSS

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to define presentational rules for content.

It controls how an HTML page looks.

## What is CSS Not?
CSS doesn’t (or, shouldn’t) provide the content on a page. The page should still be able to work as a delivery mechanism for information if the CSS disappears...

It isn’t a programming language, there is no logic - only style rules.

## What Does CSS Look Like?
CSS files are style sheets, a series of rules about what different elements on a page should look like. CSS consists of properties and values applied to elements which are specified by selectors.

The rules are specified in blocks contained within curly brackets.

For example (this is not real CSS!)

```css
selector{
	property: value;
	property2: list of values;
}
```
